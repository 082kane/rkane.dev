It was my birthday yesterday. The first without my mom. She gave birth to me when she was 30, we got to spend 30 years together, and now this is the first year without her. I dedicate every accomplishment, every change I'll make to this world for the better, every ripple forward that brings new life and energy to this word - to her. I love you mom.
